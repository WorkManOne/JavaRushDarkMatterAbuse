# JavaRushDarkMatterAbuse
Created only for educational purposes. And also just to help people who don't have dark matter on Javarush and don't know where they could get it.

What's this script about?

It's a simple CLICKER with prerecorded coordinates to click. It worked for me when I used Yandex Browser and FULL HD monitor. REMEMBER THAT. READY TO WORK .EXE FILE WORKS 100% ONLY FOR 1920x1080 resolution (because of coordinates) and Yandex Browser in full screen(but you could try to do it in your browser)

How to Abuse DarkMatter on JavaRush?

Go to JavaRush. On the left panel click "Surveys" and then click "Meeting with types, keyboard input" or smth... Scroll the page up to max, launch script, type how many dark matter you want, click ENTER and then you'll have 15 seconds to open browser on the front. Script will start iterations until it'll get your amount of coins. TO STOP IT, simply press ctrl+alt+del, otherwise you're doomed.

You can rework it if it doesn't work for you or you passed other (more valueble) test, or have some other ideas to improve it! For example I wanted to add text recognition to find right answers, or make such clickers for other tests.
